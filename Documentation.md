# Documentation

## To Do List

- [ ] Markdown Documentation Sidebar
Fixed position floating sidebar with documentation about the page. This will include the process and other information about the process of building this page. 
- [ ] GitHub Page Design
In Figma I will design how I want to page to look. Documentation for that process will go here as well. 
- [ ] SVG Timeline Animation
This is tied to the design of the page, I see a timeline style scroll that will have animations of things I have worked out or that I'm currently working on that are public. 
- [ ] Social Media Links
These links will be tied to my "professional" life, nothing personal. 

______
>NOTE
Fields under the line are still in progress and I have not decided on how I want to structure the notes to best serve dissemination.
